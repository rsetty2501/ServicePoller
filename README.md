# Service poller

## Summary
As a part of scaling the number of services running within a modern health tech
company we need a way to make sure that all are running smoothly.
None of the tools that we have been looking for are quite doing the
right thing for us so we decided that we need to build it ourselves.
What we want you to do is to build a simple service poller that keeps
a list of services (defined by a URL), and periodically does a HTTP GET
to each and saves the response ("OK" or "FAIL"). Apart from the polling logic
we want to have all the services visualised and easily managed in a basic UI
presenting all services together with their status.

## Requirements
Basic requirements (If these aren’t met the assignment will not pass):
- A user need to be able to add a new service with url, a name
- Added services have to be kept when the server is restarted
- Present whenever a service was added and when the last change was
made

## Extra requirements
- We want full create/update/delete functionality for services
- The results from the poller are not automatically shown to the user
(you have to reload the page to see results)
- We want to have informative and nice looking animations on
add/remove services
- Simultaneous writes sometimes causes strange behavior
- Protect the poller from misbehaving services (for example answering
really slowly)
- URL Validation ("sdgf" is probably not a valid service)
- Multi user support. Users should not see the services added by
another user

# Building
The recommended tool is IntelliJ IDEA.
```
-> Download ZIP or Clone the repository
-> Open IntelliJ IDEA
-> Pre-requisite:
   -> Project SDK must be setup (Java v11.0.2 (SE) is used in the project)
-> Cick "Open" -> Select Project from disk -> Load Gradle Project
```

Run java program "StartServicePoller" as shown in below screenshot to start the server:
![Alt text](./Run_instructions.png)

Alternatively, go to Terminal and run gradle command to start the server:
```
./gradlew clean run
```
If there is a permission issue when executing the above command, then run the below command in terminal:
```
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew clean run
```


- Notes: Build has been tested in macOS(High Sierra v10.13.6) only.
- Known issue: The project might not be compatible with other Java versions (such as v10 or v15).

# Testing
Open any web browser and enter the below URL:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

# Things done
I was able to complete all the basic requirements and some extra requirements:
- Basic requirements:
  - Add new service with url, and a name
  - Added services are kept/shown when the server is restarted
  - Basic UI presenting all services with Last change made and status
  - When ever a service is added, it is presented in the UI
  - Periodic poller running in the server every 30 seconds. The page must be reloaded to see the updated results
- Extra requirements:
  - URL Validation
  - Delete service (based on ID)
